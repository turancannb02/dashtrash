ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim: What Is dashtrash?
dashtrash is a terminal-based dashboard UI, built entirely in the command line, for real-time monitoring of system metrics, logs, and custom data sources â€” without relying on external SaaS dashboards or heavy GUI tools.

ðŸ§­ The Goal
To provide developers, sysadmins, and DevOps engineers with a lightweight, hackable, and visually engaging dashboard UI â€” all running inside their terminal â€” to monitor:

CPU, RAM, disk, network (system metrics)

Application and service logs

External service statuses via plugins (Docker, APIs, GitHub Actions, etc.)

ðŸ’¡ Why?
Because not every monitoring tool should:

Require a web server or database

Send data to the cloud

Make you open 4 different terminal tabs

âœ… What Makes dashtrash Unique?
Terminal-first design: You stay in the CLI, no context-switching

Fun, irreverent style: ASCII banners, ironic name, minimal BS

Highly configurable: via a simple dashboard.yml

Modular & pluggable: Add your own panels with minimal boilerplate

No telemetry, no SaaS, no bloat â€” just dashboards and vibes

ðŸ“Œ Summary Statement
dashtrash is a zero-dependency, TUI (terminal user interface) dashboard that gives you real-time visibility into your system and logs â€” all in the terminal, and all on your terms.
